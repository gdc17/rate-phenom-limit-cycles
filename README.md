# Rate-induced phenmomena in systems with attracting limit cycles
Scripts to reproduce figures and play with concepts from Chapter 2 of my phd thesis about rate-induced phenomena in systems with limit cycle attractors 

Using the prototypical example system transformed from polar coordinates
- Plotting fibres of the local pullback attractor for different values r (pba_plots.py)
- Plotting the associated phase response map  (prm_example_plots.py)
- Figure showing the isochrons of the associated autonomous system (isochron_pic.py)
- Figure showing how the average phase sensitivity and trajectory-wise phase sensitivty depend on r (phase_sensitivity_plots.py)

Using the ecological plant-herbivore model
- Phase diagram of the autonomous system (ecosystem_phaseplot.py)
- Isochrons of the autnonomous system (eco_isochrons.py)
- Rate-induced phenmomena for the ecosystem model with parameter shift (ecosystem_rtippig.py)
