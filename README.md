# Rate-induced phenmomena in systems with attracting limit cycles
Code to reproduce figures and play with concepts from Chapter 2 of my thesis which is about rate-induced phenomena in systems with limit cycle attractors. including
- illustrative example in the autonomous case. Phase plot and isochrons
- illustrative example in the non-autonomous case. Approximations of pullback attractor
- numerical approximation of phase response map and phase plot
- ecological example
