# Rate-induced phenmomena in systems with attracting limit cycles
Scripts to reproduce figures and play with concepts from Chapter 2 of my phd thesis about rate-induced phenomena in systems with limit cycle attractors using the prototypical example system. Includes
- Plotting fibres of the local pullback attractor for different values r
- Plotting the associated phase response map 
- Figure showing the isochrons of the associated autonomous system
- Figure showing how the average phase sensitivity and trajectory-wise phase sensitivty depend on r
- The ecological plant-herbivore model.
